* Services
* Media Player/Media Session
* Cache storage
* Recyclerview
* Coordinator Layout
* Content Provider
* Constrant layout
* Dialogs
* Single Activity + a lot of fragments
* a lot of data storage ideas
* A lot on android activity/fragment/services lifecycle

## Known Bugs/ Issues
* Sometimes album artist is not showing properly
