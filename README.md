# Music Player

Its a sad music player that i made to learn a lot of android stuff which includes
* Services
* Media Player/Media Session
* Cache storage
* Recyclerview
* Coordinator Layout
* Content Provider
* Single Activity + a lot of fragments
* a lot of data storage ideas

## Known Bugs/ Issues
* Sometimes album artist is not showing properly
* Sometimes switching tabs right when app starts crashes the app
* Music control in notifications refuses to go, even after closing the app


## TODO
* Optimise code
* Add seekbar in noti/playing fragment
* Improve UI
* Add genres

If u guys see any bugs that are not listed here, feel free to open an issue :D


Updates will be slower now because school term just started :P
